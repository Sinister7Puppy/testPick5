the model was supposed to predict the 5 digits of the winning number of box type bet but the model is only predicting incorrectly by just didplaying the next box type prediction repeateadly 100's of times. update the project to accurately predict the pick 5 lottery number implementing Recurrent Neural Network, gaussian Mixture Models and Markov Decission process to accurately predict the 5 digits of the winning number for box type bet, the prediction number can be jumbled but all the numbers must match.
